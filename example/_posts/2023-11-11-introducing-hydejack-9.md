{:toc .large-only}

## 이 길을 선택하게 된 계기
초등학생 때 PPT로 마우스피하기 게임을 만드는 것을 시작으로 게임개발 분야에 관심을 가지게 되었습니다. 중학생 때 처음으로 C언어 책을 펼쳤고, 이후 GameMaker라는 간단한 프로그램을 이용하여 인디게임을 개발하며 프로그래밍에 관심을 가지게 되었습니다.
<!-- Ever since the introduction of Dark Mode, link styles have been a bit of an issue. Specifically, finding an accent color that worked on both light and dark backgrounds was the problem. With Hydejack 9, the [link style](#linking-in-style) has been revamped so that legibility is no longer tied to the choice of accent_color, giving you much more freedom in creating a unique design flavor for your site. -->
 
## 성균관대학교 입학
2019년 성균관대학교 19학번으로 소프트웨어학과에 입학하여, 여러 활동과 수업에 열심히 참여하였습니다.
대표적인 활동으로는 성균SW멘토링에 참여하여 창현고등학교 학생들을 대상으로 Python을 교육하였습니다.
또한, 게임 개발 스터디에 들어가 유니티를 배워 모바일 게임을 출시하였고, 산학협력프로그램에 참여하여 SK플래닛과 GPS와 AR을 활용한 리듬게임 개발을 진행하였습니다.
<!-- The theme on which Hydejack is based was designed for a different era of the web. Hydejack has inherited many of its limitations, but over time I've made adjustments, such as centering the content column for better reading ergonomics. -->

<!--With version 9, Hydejack takes full advantage of large displays. Whether it's design indulgences such as oversized headlines, or quality of life improvements such as a floating table of contents, Hydejack now finds use for all that extra screen real estate[^1].  -->
 
## 군대
군대에서 전자계산병으로 근무하였으며, 부대 홈페이지 re-design을 담당하여 홈페이지 프론트엔드 디자인을 맡아 작업하였습니다.
<!-- Hydejack 9 now lets you use ontent cards for both projects and posts. 
The cards have been redesigned with a new hover style and drop shadows and they retain their unique transition-to-next-page animations, which now also work on the `blog` layout. The new `grid` layout lets you do that.-->

<!--Good images are key to making the most out of content cards. For that reason, a [chapter on images](../../docs/basics.md#adding-images) has been added to the documentation.대 -->
 
## 현재
성균관대학교 3학년에 재학 중이며, 6주간 진행되는 Hippo T&C의 직무체험프로그램에 참여 중이다.

<!-- Hydejack now has Built-In Search. It even works offline. I've been prototyping many approaches and eventually settled on a fully client-side, off-the-main thread solution that perfectly fits the use case of personal sites and shows surprisingly good results[^2]. 

The new search UI is custom made for Hydejack and shows beautiful previews of your posts and pages, right on top of your regular content.

Together with the Auto-Hiding Navbar, your entire content library is now only a couple of keystrokes away. -->
 
<!-- ## Auto-Hiding Navbar

A navbar that's there when you need it, and disappears when you don't. Simple as that.
 
## Sticky Table of Contents

Already a staple on so many sites on the web, this pattern is now also available in Hydejack. 
What's unique about it is that it simply picks up the table of contents already created by kramdown's `{:toc}` tag and transparently upgrades it to a fully dynamic version.
 
## …and much more

Other noteworthy changes include:
- Support for Jekyll 4
- Choice between MathJax and KaTeX for math rendering
- Use of `jekyll-include-cache` for drastically improved page building speeds
- New variables configuration file — adjust content width, sidebar width, font size, etc...
- ...and the option to disable grouping projects by year.

Read the the [CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md){:.heading.flip-title} for the full scope of features and improvements made in Hydejack 9.
Maybe just glance at it to confirm that it is indeed a pretty long list.
 
## Even More to Come

New features for 9.1 are already lined up. Code block headers and code line highlights for even better technical blogging, as well as download buttons on the resume page for PDF, vCard, and Resume JSON are just around the corner.
 
## Get It Now
The Free Version of Hydejack is now availabe on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-hydejack)
and for the first time also on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/packages). 
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack) as always.

The PRO Version is scheduled to release on July 7th on Gumroad. Pre-Orders are open now:

<div class="gumroad-product-embed" data-gumroad-product-id="nuOluY"><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/nuOluY">Loading…</a></div>



[^1]: If you are a fan of the old two-column layout, or don't like modern design tropes such as mega headlines, Hydejack lets you revert these changes on a case-by-case basis via configuration options.

[^2]:
      Search was mainly tested for English and German. Please let me know about issues in other languages. 
      While I've tried to find a multi-language solution, most showed drastically worse  results for the English base case.
      If you're technically inclined, you can adopt the code located in `_includes/js/search-worker.js` to your needs. -->
